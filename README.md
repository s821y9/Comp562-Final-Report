## Cart Pole-Q Learning




### Problem and application

The cart pole game is a well-known problem in the field of control theory and has been widely used to test reinforcement learning algorithms. In this game, a pendulum with a center of gravity above its pivot point is attached to a cart that moves horizontally along a track. The goal is to keep the pendulum balanced by applying appropriate forces to the cart.

Despite its apparent simplicity, this game is challenging for humans to control. The pendulum is inherently unstable, and even small disturbances can cause it to fall over. It requires continuous adjustments and quick reactions to
