## Cart Pole-Q Learning




### Problem and application

  The cart pole game is a well-known problem in the field of control theory and has been widely used to test reinforcement learning algorithms. In this game, a pendulum with a center of gravity above its pivot point is attached to a cart that moves horizontally along a track. The goal is to keep the pendulum balanced by applying appropriate forces to the cart.

Despite its apparent simplicity, this game is challenging for humans to control. The pendulum is inherently unstable, and even small disturbances can cause it to fall over. It requires continuous adjustments and quick reactions to maintain its balance. Achieving a high score in this game is no easy task.

To address this challenge, machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning have been used to train agents to control the cart pole game. Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to make decisions based on feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. By repeating the game thousands of times, the agent can learn from its failures and achieve a high score by avoiding the actions that lead to failure.

The implementation of machine learning in the cart pole game is not only critical for solving this specific game problem. It is also for showing machine learning's effectiveness in solving real world problems. By mastering this game using machine learning algorithms, we can gain insights into more complex problems that involve decision-making in dynamic environments. Additionally, machine learning can be used to control physical systems in robotics and other fields.
